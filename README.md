# color-namer

_color-namer_ attempts to find the nearest named color to an input.

## Concept

In a recent conversation, there was the possibility that someone was going to need arbitrary color inputs, but present the used colors in a human-readable (i.e., non-RGB) way.  That led to a side discussion around color spaces and distances.

That seemed worth writing up, and it seemed worth giving [Go](https://golang.org/) a shot.  As a disclaimer, what I've seen of Go hasn't impressed me, so this is as much to see if I can buy into the popular language or if it doesn't feel worth continuing on.
